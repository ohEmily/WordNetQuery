# WordNet API Query
Hedging research project at the Columbia University Speech Lab

Running this program allows you to query Wordnet for words stored in a csv file. The program assumes that the csv file is formatted such that there are two columns, where the first one contains the definition of the word and the second contains the word itself.

The program uses the Java API for WordNet Searching ([JAWS] (http://lyle.smu.edu/~tspell/jaws/index.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter)) to query the WordNet database. JAWS requires that the user have WordNet installed to run the program.
